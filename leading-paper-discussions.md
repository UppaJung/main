# How to lead discussion of a research paper

> [See here the list of already led discussions for the Summer term 2020](./led-papers.md)

When it’s your turn to lead the 10-15 minute discussion of the paper, please try to limit your introduction to five minutes and save the remaining time to get others to share their thoughts.

1.  > Who are the authors and why did they decide to research the topic?

2.  > What do the authors claim the results to be?

3.  > What methodology was used in any experiments?

4.  > Was there any part of the methodology, claims, or other aspect of the paper which you couldn’t understand? (Did the authors leave important details out?)

5.  > Is there any disconnect between what the authors claim and the methodology or results?

6.  > What were the least believable parts of the paper or sources of skepticism?

7.  > What were the most clever parts of the paper, or what did the authors do that you would have never thought of?

8.  > What do you wish the authors had done differently?

9.  > What results did you find most surprising?

Some suggestions when reading, and also when leading a discussion:

1.  > Note whether the authors use passive or active voice, and think about the implications of these choices.

2.  > Try to avoid reading aloud large parts of the paper when you’re doing the discussion. Try instead to describe in your own words the authors’ findings or discussions.

3.  > Don’t be afraid to state openly when you don’t understand part of a paper (or even the whole paper\!) It’s very helpful for both the instructors and the rest of the students to know when something is not clear.
