## Project: Cell Phone Privacy Protection When Attending Protests

**Group members**: Abdul, Kai and Ramadhan

**Research goal**: to find out whether people attending protests with their iPhones take any additional security methods (e.g., changing their authentication method) before attending.

## Project: iOS first-party and third-party password managers usage in Apple ecosystem

**Group members**: Bryan, Eddie, Kumud, and Vimochan

**Research goal**: To find out whether iOS users use first-party password managers (i.e., iCloud keychain) by default.

**Documents (in progress)**:

- **Main project document**: No file.
- **Informed consent**: No file.
- **Experiment ad**: No file.
- **Other material**: None yet.



## Project: Password managers users' habits

**Group members**: Christian, David and Jacky

**Research goal**: To understand whether people using password managers actually change their passwords to unique, randomly-chosen ones, or whether they simply use these apps to store their passwords, without any changes.

**Documents (in progress)**:
- **Main project document**: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PcKQS6WLADMc7Z-20VEEeBV1BkFKwFP-XWiuB2WX8cE/
- **Informed consent**: No file.
- **Experiment ad**: No file.
- **Other material**:

	* List of password managers: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15pRoX49MkOVoM3aXq1mbRLdT7YeFzjmsfCVUXfnErOc/



## Project: Privacy expectations for COVID-19 tracing applications

**Group members**: Chukwunenye, Josh, Neeraj and Ramana

**Research goal**: To find out whether there is consistency between covid19 location tracing apps (as expressed by their creators in the app privacy policies) and the users' privacy understanding and expectations of these applications.

**Documents (in progress)**:
- **Main project document**: No file.

# Things to be done

In all cases, every team should produce the following documents:

* **Informed consent**: It should contain a brief but thorough description of the experiment, so subjects are able to understand what you're trying to do before doing it.
* **Experiment ad**: A short text used to advertise the experiment, allowing you to recruit subjects. You may use this for offline (*in person*) or online recruiting (e.g., *Facebook*, *Amazon Mechanical Turk*).

Also, you should decide how much to pay each subject (and you should say it in both documents above). That depends on how long it takes a subject to go through your full experiment. An ethical payment would be around US$12 per hour of work (which is the minimum wage in California). If for example an interview takes (in average) 15 minutes, you should pay about US$3.

One question that usually emerges about this is whether you can pay more (if you have the money, of course). The answer is yes; but you should beware of paying too much because that could be coercive.
